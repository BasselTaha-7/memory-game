# Memory Card Game

This is a simple memory card game I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The goal is to match all the identical cards by flipping two at a time. If they match, they stay flipped â€” if not, they flip back.

## Features

- Works on both desktop and mobile
- Simple clean design
- Flip animations using CSS
- Restart button to reset the game anytime

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Why I Built It

I wanted to practice my JavaScript skills by building something interactive and fun.  
This project helped me understand how to work with the DOM, events, and game logic in a practical way.

## Future Ideas

- Add a timer and a score counter  
- Add sound effects  
- Save high scores using local storage
